    <h1>My Class Review</h1>
    <p>
        This class has been good for learning the basics of building websites. Learning HTML was really hard at first, and I'm just getting started,
        so it's still hard for me in some ways. But in the past week, I have understood more than I thought I would. Building websites is fun, and this class
        has introduced me to lots of things in a way that makes learning it a faster process.
