        <h1>all about fruits</h1>
        <h2>fruits come in all different shapes and sizes, and they all have different distinct textures and flavors. Some can be sweet, while some are sour and bitter. 
            My favorite things about fruites is that in different parts of the world you will find different types of fruits! Not only that, fruits come in diffrent colors, 
            and even mixtures of them, some can have a solid color while some have gradiants of mulitples. With fruits you never know what you can expect, for example with the fruit called Tamarin. 
            They grow off a tree, on the outside it has a brown hard woodlike texture, its smooth and you can tell it has some type of beads in it, distorting the shape of the fruit.
             When you open it the fruit is a rich dark shade of brown, sometimes the fruit can come out dry but sometimes is comes out fresh. Most of the time its sour a bitter with a little sweetness to it but sometmes it can 
             be completly sour. But if you are lucky it will come out totally sweetr, and when they are sweet  they can be one of the best types of fruits to snack on. Another reason fruits interest me is because
             you can use them in different type of dishes and drinks, most commonly used in deserts.</h2>

         <h2>Fruits werent always like the ones you see at super markets, that why they interest me so much. Bsck then lots of years ago fruits used to look completly differnt then the ones you may knoiw of now. For example
            bananas were compltly differnt, they had big black seeds in them and barly and fruit to taste. But over the years humans have learned to plant them in a way we can get a tasty 
            fruit.
