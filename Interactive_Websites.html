    <h1>Why I Love Watercolors</h1>

    <p>
        Watercolor paints are so beautiful. They let me be able to make gorgeous, flowy drawings where the colors blend in with themselves. It’s relaxing to watch the paint mix with itself. I like that the layers look light and almost see-through. It’s better than messy oil paints in my opinion, and every painting comes out looking unique because the water does its own thing, leaving me with a unique one-of-a-kind drawing.
